           Land vehicles are classified broadly by what is used to apply steering and drive forces against the ground:<br>
      wheeled, tracked, railed or skied. ISO 3833-1977 is the standard, also internationally used in legislation, for<br>
       road vehicles types, terms and definitions.<sup>[3]</sup>
